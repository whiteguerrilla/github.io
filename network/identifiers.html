                Identifying network resources has always been awkward. While they obviously must be unique, an identifier should connote
                meaning, shouldn't it? How should we identify our servers? Our printers? Our workstations? Many small organizations
                innocently opt to identify workstations by the employee to which they were originally assigned, with perhaps
                the operating system or manufacturer woven in for good measure. Printers are often identified by the department
                or user to which they are assigned, and servers for the role they were originally intended.
            </p>
            <p>
                And this seems to work quite well, for a while. IT support personnel are able to identify a malfunctioning network interface
                card on the network simply by its network identifier.
            </p>
            <p>
                But changing network resource identifiers is difficult, and after Bill is long gone, Sharon uses Bill's Windows Vista computer.
                And now there are two Mikes, and they both use Windows 10! The identification system didn't account for these
                changes, and now things are just confusing. The IT department, no longer able to trust the accuracy of their
                own network resource identifiers, quietly builds an asset management system which lets them associate several
                helpful attributes with any network resource, oblivious to the users who continue to see meaningless identifiers
                on the network (and have begun to wonder if their IT department really knows what they are doing).
            </p>

                One day an important printer fails, and the decision is made to relocate an adjacent department's printer to a central location
                so the two departments can share it. As a result, both Finance and Sales are now printing their documents
                to the same relocated Sales Printer. After a while, everyone gets used to this, but new employees are baffled
                as to why it was not simply renamed to something more generic. The reason? Of course! An old program still
                references the sales printer by its original network identifier "Sales LaserJet 5si" for its automated reports,
                and no one still working at the company knows how to modify it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Several months later, the mail server is end-of-life. The original email server was given the simple identifier "mail" and
                the current email server "mail5," so the new server will be identified as "mail6." The two servers will coexist
                on the network while mailboxes are migrated from mail5 to mail6, and then mail5 will be decommissioned and
                mail6 will be activated. But when that happens, the new systems administrator fails to realize that the
                <strong>credit card processing software</strong> was also installed on mail5 (the silly lad assumed mail5 was strictly
                for mail) and that goes down until panicked users realize and report the outage. Now the business is in a
                pickle! If the old mail5 server (decommissioned for several hours now) rejoins the network, users will connect
                to it instead of mail6, and mailboxes will likely become corrupt. After several hours, the credit card processing
                software is reinstalled on the voicemail server "voice2" and service is restored.

                Unfortunately, things only get worse as time goes on.
            </p>
            <p>
                When one takes a step back and looks at the situation, the problem is clear: network resource identifiers must be unique,
                <i>but they do
                    <strong>not</strong> need to connote any sort of meaning!</i> As a matter of fact,
                <strong>they should connote absolutely no meaning at all, to anyone!!!</strong> Like social security numbers, which
                uniquely identify humans, network resource identifiers are simply unique identifiers.
                <u>Nothing more.</u>
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to our social security numbers, we have more memorable names we give to our friends. These names may or may not
                be unique, but at least they are memorable.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's great for us, but how do users find network resources if not by their unique identifier? Fortunately, there is a technology
                that permits network resources to be associated with more memorable names too. It is the same technology
                that transforms 172.217.0.36 into the friendlier "www.google.com" and it is called DNS. What's more, DNS
                permits
                <i>multiple</i> friendly names for the same resource. In the tale above, if DNS were used to assign the sales
                and finance printers their names, the sales printer could have been given the moniker of simply "Sales Printer,"
                and when it was relocated, the alias of "Finance Printer" for as long as it served that additional role.
            </p>
            <p>
                DNS is just a database, so changing DNS names is easy. And if the fateful end-of-life mail server had been named something
                less meaningful, with DNS used to assign it a moniker for each role it served, that system administrator
                would have known from day one that it was also responsible for the other role. With DNS, it is trivial to
                assign an additional name to a network resource, or move names from an old resource to a new one (keeping
                users and legacy software happy).
            </p>
            <p>
                So roles and functions should reside in a database, and network resources should therefore be uniquely assigned something
                short and meaningless to prevent anyone from assuming its role or function. A pseudo-random four-character
                name is sufficient for this purpose, as it affords 32
                <sup>4</sup> (omitting the profanity enablers A,I,O and U) unique network resources, which is plenty for the future
                growth of most companies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Peace, brother.
